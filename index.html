            <p>Calculators make for a popular first project, modeled after the Google Calculator because, you know, why reinvent the wheel? This calculator is able to handle all basic operators a user of a basic calculator would ever need. Because it was modeled after Google's calculator, this includes a smart parentheses button that knows exactly when to give you an open or closed parenthesis based on what it sees. This arduous button was no small feat, please be nice and try not to break it.</p>
