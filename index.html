            <p>Calculators make for a popular first project, modeled after the Google Calculator because, you know, why reinvent the wheel? This calculator is able to handle all basic operators a user of a basic calculator would ever need. Because it was modeled after Google's calculator, this includes a smart parentheses button that knows exactly when to give you an open or closed parenthesis based on what it sees. This arduous button was no small feat, please be nice and try not to break it.</p>

            <p>Get ready for the sequel to innovation; the brilliance of extracting basic informationâ€”a task that has never been done before, except for the countless times it has. This web scraper is here to automate information gathering, designed to check fluctuating Amazon market prices, and perform questionable data collection from Spotify, YouTube, and Instagram. Just point it to a music playlist, video playlist, or a specific influencer, and watch the program work its magic.</p>
